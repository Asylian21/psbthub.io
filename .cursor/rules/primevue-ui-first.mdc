# PrimeVue First for UI

When implementing UI in this project, prefer existing PrimeVue components first.

## Decision order

1. Use a PrimeVue component when it can satisfy the requirement directly.
2. Configure or compose PrimeVue components before creating a custom component.
3. Build a custom UI component only if there is no suitable PrimeVue option, or if required behavior/styling cannot be achieved reasonably with PrimeVue.

## Implementation guidance

- Reuse PrimeVue patterns, props, and accessibility behavior whenever possible.
- Keep custom wrappers thin when extending PrimeVue (do not duplicate full component behavior).
- For custom components, document briefly why PrimeVue was not sufficient.

## Examples

- Prefer `DataTable`, `Dialog`, `Dropdown`, `InputText`, `Button`, `Toast` from PrimeVue when applicable.
- Avoid creating a custom modal, table, select, or button if PrimeVue already provides an acceptable solution.
