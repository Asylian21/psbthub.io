# English Only

All project content must be written exclusively in English. This includes:

- Source code (variable names, function names, class names)
- Code comments (inline, block, JSDoc/TSDoc)
- Documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, changelogs)
- Commit messages
- Error messages and user-facing strings
- TODO/FIXME annotations
- File and directory names

No exceptions. If translating existing non-English content, replace it with clear English equivalents.
